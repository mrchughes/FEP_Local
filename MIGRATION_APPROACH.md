# Migration Approach: Porting Apps to Docker, MongoDB Atlas, and Cloudflare

## 1. Assess Current App Architecture
- Identify all app components/services (APIs, frontends, workers, etc.).
- List dependencies (DynamoDB, environment variables, networking, etc.).

## 2. Dockerize Each App
- For each app/service:
  - Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the app.
  - Ensure all dependencies are installed in the container.
  - Externalize configuration (env vars, secrets).

## 3. Create a Docker Compose Setup
- Write a `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate all services.
- Remove DynamoDB dependencies; instead, configure services to use MongoDB Atlas.
- Set up service networking and ports.

## 4. Migrate from DynamoDB to MongoDB Atlas
- Update app code to use MongoDB drivers/ORMs instead of DynamoDB.
- Refactor data models and queries as needed.
- Store MongoDB Atlas connection string in environment variables.

## 5. Configure Cloudflare for Inbound Connectivity
- Set up a Cloudflare tunnel (Cloudflare Zero Trust) to expose local Docker services securely.
- Map your desired domain/subdomain to the local service via Cloudflare.
- Update DNS records in Cloudflare to point to the tunnel.

## 6. Test Locally
- Start all services with Docker Compose.
- Verify connectivity to MongoDB Atlas.
- Test inbound access via Cloudflare tunnel/domain.

## 7. Documentation & Automation
- Document the setup and migration steps.
- Optionally, create scripts for setup, migration, and teardown.
