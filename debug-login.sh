echo "üìã ISSUE: User doesn't see dashboard after login"
echo "üí° EXPECTED: After login ‚Üí Dashboard page with progress"
echo "‚ùå ACTUAL: User doesn't see dashboard"
echo ""

echo "üß™ DEBUGGING STEPS:"
echo ""
echo "1. Open browser DevTools (F12)"
echo "2. Go to Console tab"
echo "3. Login with your test account"
echo "4. Check for these logs:"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Should see: 'Login called with userData: {...}'"
echo "‚úÖ Should see navigation to '/dashboard'"
echo "‚ùå Check for errors in console"
echo ""

echo "5. Go to Network tab"
echo "6. Login again and check:"
echo "‚úÖ POST request to /api/auth/login should return 200"
echo "‚úÖ Response should contain user data with token"
echo ""

echo "7. Go to Application tab ‚Üí Local Storage"
echo "‚úÖ Should see 'user' key with token"
echo ""

echo "8. Check URL after login:"
echo "‚úÖ Should be: https://yoursite.com/dashboard"
echo "‚ùå If different URL, note what it shows"
echo ""

echo "üîß POTENTIAL FIXES:"
echo ""
echo "Fix 1: Remove FormPage redirect interference"
echo "Fix 2: Ensure PrivateRoute works correctly"
echo "Fix 3: Check AuthContext navigation timing"
echo ""

echo "üìù MANUAL TEST RESULTS:"
echo "‚ñ° Login API call succeeds (200 response)"
echo "‚ñ° User data stored in localStorage"
echo "‚ñ° Console shows 'Login called with userData'"
echo "‚ñ° URL changes to /dashboard"
echo "‚ñ° Dashboard component renders"
echo "‚ñ° No JavaScript errors in console"
echo ""

echo "üíæ QUICK FIXES TO TRY:"
echo ""
echo "1. Clear localStorage before testing:"
echo "   - F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí Clear All"
echo ""
echo "2. Try direct navigation:"
echo "   - After login, manually go to: yoursite.com/dashboard"
echo ""
echo "3. Check if you're redirected to form/tasks:"
echo "   - Note the final URL after login attempt"
echo ""

echo "üö® If dashboard doesn't show, likely causes:"
echo "1. User data missing token (check localStorage)"
echo "2. PrivateRoute not recognizing authentication"
echo "3. FormPage useEffect redirecting away from dashboard"
echo "4. AuthContext login function not working"
echo ""

echo "üìû NEXT STEPS:"
echo "Run through the debugging steps above and report:"
echo "1. What URL you end up on after login"
echo "2. What's in localStorage under 'user' key"
echo "3. Any console errors"
echo "4. Whether the login API call succeeds"
