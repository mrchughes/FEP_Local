## Progress Tracking

Regular updates will be made to this document as implementation progresses. Each completed task will be marked and documented with implementation details and any issues encountered.

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**
   - Organize tests by feature/component
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Group related tests in describe blocks

2. **Test Data Management**
   - Use fixtures for test data
   - Reset test data between tests
   - Use realistic test data

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows
   - Performance tests for critical paths

4. **Continuous Testing**
   - Run tests on every commit
   - Maintain high code coverage
   - Prioritize failing tests

5. **Application Validation**
   - After each test implementation phase, validate that the application still builds and runs
   - Use Docker to verify containerization works correctly
   - Run startup script to ensure all services work together
   - Execute test scripts to verify test infrastructure works
