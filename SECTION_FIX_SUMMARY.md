# Section Missing and Data Clearing Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Form Sections
**Problem**: Several sections were missing from the summary screen or collection steps.

**Root Cause**: Field name mismatches between `formProgress.js` and actual form implementation, plus missing fields in form steps.

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Field Name Alignment
- **Evidence Section**: Fixed `formProgress.js` to use `['evidence']` instead of `['deathCertificate', 'funeralBill', 'benefitEvidence', 'additionalDocuments']`

#### Missing Fields Added to Form Steps

**Step 4 - Address of the person who died**:
- ✅ Added: `deceasedUsualAddress` - "Was this their usual address?" (Yes/No radio)

**Step 5 - Responsibility for funeral arrangements**:
- ✅ Added: `nextOfKin` - "Next of kin details" (optional textarea)
- ✅ Added: `otherResponsiblePerson` - "Other responsible person" (optional text input)

**Step 6 - Funeral details**:
- ✅ Added: `funeralDate` - "Date of funeral" (optional date input)
- ✅ Added: `funeralLocation` - "Location of funeral" (optional text input)

**Step 7 - Financial circumstances**:
- ✅ Added: `employmentStatus` - "Employment status" (optional text input)
- ✅ Added: `otherIncome` - "Other income" (optional textarea)

### 2. Data Clearing Issue
**Problem**: Returning to "my applications" after the review screen cleared all data.

**Root Cause**: FormPage was auto-saving empty default data before database load completed.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added `isLoadingData` guard to prevent localStorage saves during initial load
- ✅ Added `isLoadingData` guard to prevent database auto-saves during initial load
- ✅ Enhanced loading state management to prevent race conditions

## Technical Implementation

### Form Structure Alignment
Now all form sections properly collect the fields defined in `formStructure.js`:

1. **Personal details**: firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, nationalInsuranceNumber
2. **Contact details**: address, postcode, phoneNumber, email
3. **About deceased**: deceasedFirstName, deceasedLastName, deceasedDateOfBirth, deceasedDateOfDeath, relationshipToDeceased
4. **Deceased address**: deceasedAddress, deceasedPostcode, deceasedUsualAddress
5. **Responsibility**: responsibilityReason, nextOfKin, otherResponsiblePerson
6. **Funeral details**: funeralDirector, funeralCost, funeralDate, funeralLocation, burialOrCremation
7. **Financial circumstances**: benefitsReceived, employmentStatus, savings, otherIncome
8. **Evidence**: evidence (array of selected documents)
9. **Declaration**: declarationAgreed, informationCorrect, notifyChanges

### Data Persistence Guards
```javascript
// Prevent saving during initial load
useEffect(() => {
    if (isLoadingData) return; // 🛡️ Guard added
    saveFormData(user?.id, formData);
    // ...
}, [formData, user?.id, isLoadingData]);

// Prevent auto-save during initial load
const autoSaveToDatabase = async () => {
    if (!user?.token || isLoadingData) return; // 🛡️ Guard enhanced
    // ...
};
```

## Verification

### Expected Behavior
1. ✅ All 9 sections appear in form collection steps
2. ✅ All 9 sections appear in task list with correct status
3. ✅ All 9 sections appear in review page with complete data
4. ✅ Navigation between pages preserves all data
5. ✅ Data only clears after successful final submission

### Testing Status
- 🔧 **Code Changes**: Deployed
- 🧪 **Testing**: Ready for manual verification
- 📋 **Test Plan**: Available in `COMPLETE_SECTION_FIX_TEST.md`

### Files Modified
- `mern-app/frontend/src/pages/FormPage.js` - Added missing fields to steps 4, 5, 6, 7
- `mern-app/frontend/src/utils/formProgress.js` - Fixed evidence section field names
- `mern-app/frontend/src/pages/FormPage.js` - Added data loading guards

## Next Steps
1. **Manual Testing**: Follow test plan in `COMPLETE_SECTION_FIX_TEST.md`
2. **Verification**: Confirm all 9 sections work end-to-end
3. **Validation**: Test navigation without data loss
4. **Documentation**: Update any user guides if needed

The application should now properly collect, display, and persist all form data across all 9 sections without any data clearing issues during navigation.
