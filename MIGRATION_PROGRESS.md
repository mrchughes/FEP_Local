# Step 1: Initial Assessment (Complete)

## App Structure Identified
- **Backend:** `mern-app/backend` (Node.js/Express, now being migrated to MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose)
- **Frontend:** `mern-app/frontend` (React, built with Nginx for production)

# Step 2: Backend Migration to MongoDB Atlas (In Progress)
- Replaced DynamoDB service with Mongoose-based MongoDB service (`services/dynamodbService.js` now uses Mongoose and the new `models/user.js`).
- Updated `package.json` to remove AWS SDK and add Mongoose.
- Created base `docker-compose.yml` for local orchestration.

## Next Steps
- Update controllers and middleware to ensure all DynamoDB logic is now using MongoDB/Mongoose.
- Test backend service locally with MongoDB Atlas connection string.
- Update documentation and environment variable templates.
