# Implementation Status of PDS Integration Requirements

This document tracks the implementation status of the PDS integration requirements as specified in the `PDS-Integration.md` document.

## 1. PDS Connection Flow

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- User opt-in for PDS connection
- WebID processing and resolution
- Service discovery
- Service registration mapping

## 2. PDS Registration Process

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Registration API endpoint
- DID verification challenge-response process
- Service key generation
- Registration storage

## 3. SOLID OIDC Authentication Flow

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Authentication initialization
- Authentication callback
- Token exchange
- Token refresh mechanism
- User redirection

## 4. Field Mapping Logic

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Configurable mapping system for different credential types
- Fallback system for when direct mappings fail
- Fuzzy matching for similar field names
- Field normalization for different data types
- UI for manual mapping adjustments
- Mapping history for future reference

### Implementation Details

The field mapping logic has been implemented with the following components:

1. **Backend Services**:
   - `fieldMappingService.js`: Service for field normalization and common mapping operations
   - `credentialMappingController.js`: Controller for handling credential mapping operations

2. **Data Models**:
   - `PDSCredentialMapping.js`: MongoDB model for storing credential field mapping history

3. **Frontend Components**:
   - `PDSCredentialFieldMapping.js`: UI component for selecting and mapping credentials to form fields
   - Enhanced `ApplicationForm.js`: Updated form UI that integrates credential mapping

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/mapping/applications/:applicationId/apply-credential`: Apply credential mappings to an application
   - `GET /api/mapping/applications/:applicationId/mapping-history`: Get mapping history for an application
   - `GET /api/mapping/mapping-suggestions/:credentialType`: Get field mapping suggestions for a credential type
   - `POST /api/mapping/normalize-field`: Normalize a field value based on target type

5. **Testing**:
   - `test-credential-mapping.sh`: Script for testing credential field mapping

For more details, see the [PDS-Credential-Field-Mapping.md](../docs/PDS-Credential-Field-Mapping.md) document.

## 5. Verifiable Credential Processing

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- VC selection and upload
- Credential schema normalization
- VC data model

## 6. Verification and Trust

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Credential verification logic
- Display verification status to the user
- Configurable trusted issuer list
- Revocation checking

## 7. VC Viewing Requirements

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- VC list view
- VC deletion
- VC detail view
