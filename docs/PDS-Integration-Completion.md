## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

1. **Services**
   - `pdsService.js`: Core PDS service for working with WebID and PDS providers
   - `pdsAuthService.js`: Authentication service for PDS OIDC flow
   - `pdsCredentialService.js`: Service for managing verifiable credentials
   - `didChallengeService.js`: Service for DID challenge-response verification
   - `fieldMappingService.js`: Service for credential field normalization and mapping

2. **Controllers**
   - `pdsController.js`: Controller for PDS provider and connection management
   - `pdsCredentialController.js`: Controller for credential management
   - `didChallengeController.js`: Controller for DID challenge-response endpoints
   - `credentialMappingController.js`: Controller for credential field mapping operations

3. **Models**
   - `pdsRegistration.js`: For storing PDS provider information
   - `pdsUserSession.js`: For storing user session data with PDS
   - `PDSCredentialMapping.js`: For storing credential field mapping history

4. **Routes**
   - `pdsRoutes.js`: Routes for PDS management
   - `pdsCredentialRoutes.js`: Routes for credential management
   - `didChallengeRoutes.js`: Routes for DID challenge-response endpoints
   - `credentialMappingRoutes.js`: Routes for credential field mapping operations

### Frontend Components

1. **Connection Management**
   - `PDSConnection.js`: Component for connecting to and disconnecting from PDS
   - `PDSConnectedSuccess.js`: Success page after PDS connection
   - `PDSConnectionStatus.js`: Component for displaying PDS connection status

2. **Credential Management**
   - `PDSCredentials.js`: Component for viewing stored credentials
   - `PDSCredentialFieldMapping.js`: Component for mapping credential fields to form fields

3. **Form Integration**
   - Enhanced `ApplicationForm.js`: Form with credential mapping capability

## Key Features

1. **SOLID OIDC Authentication**: Standard-based authentication with PDS providers
2. **DID Challenge-Response**: Verify DID ownership through challenge-response protocol
3. **Verifiable Credentials**: Store and retrieve verifiable credentials
4. **Credential Field Mapping**: Auto-fill forms using verifiable credentials
   - Automatic field mapping based on field names
   - Manual field adjustment capabilities
   - Field normalization for different data types
   - Mapping history tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Mapping Logic**: Implement more sophisticated mapping algorithms using machine learning
2. **Batch Mapping**: Allow mapping multiple credentials at once
3. **Credential Schemas**: Support standardized credential schemas for better mapping
4. **Selective Disclosure**: Allow users to select which fields to disclose
5. **Real-time Collaboration**: Enable collaborative mapping for shared applications

## Conclusion

The PDS integration implementation is now complete, with all major requirements fulfilled. The system provides a seamless integration with any standards-compliant Personal Data Store, allowing users to leverage their verifiable credentials to streamline the application process.

Users can now:
- Connect to their PDS using standard OIDC authentication
- Select verifiable credentials from their PDS
- Map credential fields to application form fields
- Automatically populate forms with verified data

This implementation enhances the user experience by reducing manual data entry and leveraging the security and privacy benefits of the PDS ecosystem.
