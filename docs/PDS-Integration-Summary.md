3. **Route Integration**:
   - Updated `App.js` to include new PDS routes
   - Added PDS link to `DashboardPage.js`

### Authentication

1. **OneLogin Integration**:
   - Implemented OIDC authentication flow with OneLogin
   - Added support for WebID aliases and PDS tokens
   - Created frontend components for OneLogin authentication
   - Updated authentication middleware to support both JWT and OneLogin tokens

### Testing

1. **Test Scripts**:
   - `test-pds-integration.sh`: Script for testing PDS integration
   - `test-credential-mapping.sh`: Script for testing credential field mapping
   - `test-onelogin-integration.sh`: Script for testing OneLogin integration
   - `setup-onelogin-env.sh`: Script for setting up OneLogin environment variables

### Documentation

1. **README Updates**:
